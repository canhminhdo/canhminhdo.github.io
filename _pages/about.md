# Who am I

My name is Canh Minh Do, I am a 1st Ph.D. student at Japan Advanced Institute of Science
and Technology (JAIST). My research interests are mainly in the areas of formal method
and software verification. Besides, machine learning and deep learning that could be
applied to verification tasks.

Before I became a Ph.D. student at JAIST, I graduated from JAIST with a master's degree
in Computer Science. My supervisor is Kazuhiro Ogata who has been leading me through
the master's degree until now. I would like to express my deep gratitude to him due to
his endless support without uncondition.

I am a motivated person who wants to work hard to solve problems as well as applying the
state of art technologies to improve our daily life.
