# Who am I

My name is Canh Minh Do, a **Ph.D.** in information science who is interested in the areas of formal methods,
such as formal specification, interactive theorem proving and model checking, tools supporting
formal methods. My research focuses on mitigating the state space explosion in model checking and improving the running performance of model checking by parallelization. Currently, I have been working on formal verification of quantum systems.

Besides, I am also a senior software engineer who would like to apply cutting-edge technologies into improving our daily life.
