Hi, I'm Canh, an assistant professor at School of Information Science, <a href='https://jaist.ac.jp/english/'>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST)</a>. My primary research interests are in the areas of formal methods, such as formal specification, interactive theorem proving and model checking, and tools supporting formal methods. My research focuses on formal specification and verification of concurrent/distributed systems for both conventional and emerging technologies. I obtained my Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in Information Science, JAIST, advised by Prof. Kazuhiro Ogata.

<b>Research interests:</b> Computer Science, Software Engineering, Formal Methods.
